# StellarMarket

A decentralized freelance marketplace built on **Stellar/Soroban**, enabling trustless work agreements with escrow payments, on-chain reputation, and decentralized dispute resolution.

## Overview

StellarMarket connects freelancers and clients through a transparent, blockchain-powered platform. Smart contracts handle payment escrow, milestone tracking, and dispute arbitration — eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries.
